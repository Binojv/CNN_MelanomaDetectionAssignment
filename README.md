# Project Name: Melanoma Detection Assignment
> Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Project is executed using Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Keras, Augmentor and Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab environment utilizing GPU runtime.
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- The dataset provided consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Accuracy on the training data increased by using Augmentor library
- Model is still overfitting but this can be solved by adding more layers, or dropout layers
- Further improvement can be achieved by tuning the hyperparameter
